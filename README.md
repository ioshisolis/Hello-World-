# Hello-World-
Welcome to my world. 

We all have something inside that connects with our soul. "Esp√≠ritu" 

Words tend to be overwealming to me. Silence embraces most of the fears inside a trouble mind that calls it self insomnia. 

Telling our self the truth has different meanings and different outcomes. 

There is NO precise moment or reason why this world came to be. 

Just is. Enjoy it
